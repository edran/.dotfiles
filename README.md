# Dotfiles

A costant work in progress.

Compatible with `Ubuntu 14.04` and `12.04` (see `precise` branch).
Does not include my emacs and xmonad configurations yet, as to avoid
the various dependecies that come with them.

# Installation
* `$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:edran/.dotfiles`
* `$ ./.dotfiles/install.sh`
* `$ pip install thefuck`
