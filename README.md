# edran's dotfiles

***

Compatible with `MacOS Mojave`. Most of the configuration can be found in
`dots/`. The installation process used to be based on ansible, but `master` is
currently in the process of being updated, so this is probably not true anymore.

Feel free to check things out, and copy whatever is needed :)
